    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>

      Highly experienced software engineer with skills ranging across
      the full network stack. I am confident working with many data
      stores, access patterns, API designs, and frontend web
      frameworks.

    <p>

      My unique trait is that I bring an engagement to my tasks that means I
      regularly push for improvements and ideas because I genuinely believe
      them to be better, and because this belief drives me to seek high quality
      engineering.

    <p>

      The diversity of tooling I have used has taught me the general patterns
      and difficulties that underlie and are common to all technologies, rather
      than falsely believing that any given tool choice is a panacea.

    <p>

      While my professional career has focused on web technology, my
      academic background enables me to creatively engineer solutions
      in other domains. Personal projects involve anything from audio
      processing to functional programming.

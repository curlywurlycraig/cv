    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>

    I'm a software engineer with extensive experience across the full network
    stack, confident working with diverse data stores, access patterns, API
    designs, and frameworks. My approach balances deep problem-solving
    with the pragmatism needed to ship practical fixes and keep momentum.

    <p>

    Years of working with varied tools have taught me to recognize the underlying
    patterns and challenges common to all technologies, avoiding the trap of
    treating any tool as a universal solution. While my professional focus has been
    on web technology, my academic background empowers me to tackle problems
    creatively across domains. My personal projects span from audio processing to
    functional programming, reflecting a curiosity that drives both my work and
    learning.

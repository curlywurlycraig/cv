    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>

      Highly experienced software engineer with skills ranging across
      the full network stack. I am confident working with many data
      stores, access patterns, API designs, and frontend web
      frameworks.

    <p>

      My broad experience has given me a skillset that enables me to
      see a technological problem and ensure its completion, utilising excellent
      communication and collaboration along the way.

    <p>

      While my professional career has focused on web technology, my
      academic background enables me to creatively engineer solutions
      in other domains. Personal projects involve anything from audio
      processing to functional programming.
